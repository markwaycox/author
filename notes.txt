Why am I doing this
BoBiB (Black on Black in Black
Positive contribution to Brother Mark's writing career.
Get more experience designing websites and writing code.

Final Product: A simple website that will give Mark and online presence.
On a scale of 0-10 I believe the website will top out at a 6.

Commitment: To work on the website as long as I have the inspiration 
and health to do so. If Mark or Michael wishes to discontinue working on 
the website no explanation is neccessary.
