<p>I’m the author of three, new promising novels. I also teach kid’s English for fun. When I’m not pumping out incredible material, I travel the globe absorbing culture. My blog, LIT up LIT, lends a platform for the examination of explosive literature and other art that shed insights into today’s most pressing happenings. The species of this planet are under serious duress & threat. LIT up LIT’s pledge is to shine the spotlight on accountability, a commodity appearing increasingly less and less.</p>
